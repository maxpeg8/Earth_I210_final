### Project Summary

Our Topic: Moons of Uranus
We chose this topic for two main reasons; it was a theme category provided, and one of Uranus' moons shares the name Miranda with a member of our group.
Our site will consist of 6 pages: a home page and 5 pages for Uranus' 5 main moons (Puck, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon). One member will do the home page and a moon page while the remaining two members will each do 2 moon pages.
